# User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to drag basic blocks (Prompt, LLM, External Function, Condition) onto a canvas so that I can build workflows visually.
- **As a user**, I want each block to store inputs/outputs and metadata so that the workflow can be serialized to JSON.
- **As a user**, I want to connect blocks and arrange them in the canvas.
- **As a developer**, I need to serialize the diagram to JSON to send it to the backend.
